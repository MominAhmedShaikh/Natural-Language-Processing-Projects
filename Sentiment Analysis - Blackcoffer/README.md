<p>I have developed a sentiment analytics program in Python which analyzes extracted articles from Blackcoffer’s blogs as positive or negative while considering positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, percentage of complex words, fog index etc.
</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>This Project includes 2 executable files, 2 Output files as well as 4 helper programs as follows:
</p>
<h4>Executable Files:</h4>
<ul>


  <li><b>requirements.txt</b> - Includes all the required libraries for program. </li>
  <li><b>main.py</b> - Includes all functions required for sentiment analytics while using functions defined in utils.py  generates textfiles and  Output.csv</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Output.csv</b> - Stores all the metrics such  as positive or negative while considering positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, percentage of complex words, fog index etc.</li>
  <li><b>textfiles folder</b> - Contains articles and there headings as a part of extraction process.</li>
</ul>




<h4>Source Directories:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Input.xlsx - Sheet1.csv</b> - Includes all the requirements for the analytical phase of the program from stopswords to input.csv</li>
  <li><b>wordfiles</b> - Includes all the textiles having stopwords. </li>
  <li><b>utils.py</b> - Contains helper functions and configurable variables.</li>
  <li><b>Questions And Helper Files</b> - Includes Questions from Blackcoffer’s Assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h2> :book: Sentiment Analysis</h2>

<p>Product managers can better understand client sentiments by using sentiment analysis, a potent marketing technique, in their advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>In terms of consumer loyalty, satisfaction, the effectiveness of advertising and marketing, and product acceptance, it plays a significant role. Product managers and customer success managers can more precisely change their product roadmap with the support of an understanding of consumer psychology.</p>

<p>The phrase "emotion-based marketing" refers to a wide range of emotional consumer reactions, including "positive," "negative," "neutral," "negative," "uptight," "disgust," "frustration," and others. Increasing brand and product recall also requires an understanding of the psychology of consumer reactions.</p>

<h2> :clipboard: Execution Instruction</h2>
<p>The order of execution of the program files is as follows:</p>
<p><b>1) requirements.txt</b></p>
<p>First, the requirements.txt file must be executed to download all the required packages required for analytical operations.</p>
<p><b>2) main.py</b></p>
<p>Then, the main.py file must be executed, which leads to the production of the textfiles folder and Output.csv , At the beginning of this file, the utils has been imported so that the functions defined in it can be used.</p>
